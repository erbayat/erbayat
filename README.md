👋 Hello, I'm Egemen!

📚 I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical Engineering at GW ECE, specializing in ML, computer vision, and network applications.

🎓 Proud Alumnus of BOUN EE.

🐎 I'm passionate about horse riding and exploring the great outdoors through hiking.

💻 When I'm not on a horse or a trail, you can find me coding. I'm fluent in Python, C++, MATLAB, and more.

🌟 Let's make the digital world more exciting, one line of code at a time!
